# Electronic-Duffing

## Overview
This repository contains files for the realization of an electronic Duffing oscillator, i.e., a circuit which simulates Duffing's equation
    $m\ddot{x} + c\dot{x} + kx + k_3 x^3 = f_{ext}(t).$

The circuit diagrams were realized with KiCad7.0 (https://www.kicad.org/).
